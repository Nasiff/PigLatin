# PigLatin
A simple Android App that I made which translates words and sentences into PigLatin.

This App not only translates the inputted English words/sentences into PigLatin but I also implemented a feature which uses the TTS (Text To Speech) feature of the android device and on pressing the 'Speak' button causes the device to 'speak' out the translated Piglatin text out aloud.

I also implemented another button which cleared the input text box in which the user is asked to put in the English word/sentence.
