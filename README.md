# PigLatin
A simple Android App which translates words and sentences into PigLatin.

### What It Does
This App not only translates the inputted English words/sentences into PigLatin but I also implemented a feature which uses the TTS (Text To Speech) functionality of the android device and on pressing the 'Speak' button causes the device to 'speak' out the translated Piglatin text out aloud.
I also implemented another button which cleared the input text box in which the user is asked to put in the English word/sentence.

Will add UI design in a later update!
